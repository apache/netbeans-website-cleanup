*Write standards-based web and enterprise applications that can be accessed from a wide range of clients such as web browsers, mobile devices and more. Get unmatched out-of-the-box experience: With a few clicks, create Java EE 6 apps with support for all relevant Java EE 6 technologies.*

=== Web and Enterprise Application Development

The NetBeans IDE provides full support for Java EE 6. Develop components including web pages, servlets, web services, Enterprise Java Beans (EJB 3.1), [postbody]#JSF, JPA,# and use JSR 299 support for Contexts and Dependency Injection.

=== Web Frameworks

The NetBeans IDE make it easy to create Java EE projects that rely on the JavaServer Faces 2.1 (Facelets), Spring, Struts, and Hibernate frameworks. The editor supports code completion, navigation and refactoring for mapping files.

=== Deployment, Debugging and Profiling

You can deploy your applications to GlassFish, WebLogic, Tomcat or JBoss server. The Deploy on Save feature lets you see changes to your application immediately after you save files in the editor. You can also place breakpoints in your Java or JSP files and debug your app, or profile it using the NetBeans profiler.

=== Multi-Language Editor Support

Take advantage of full syntax highlighting, code completion, pop-up documentation, and error checking for JSP, JSF, XML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP - even mixed.
