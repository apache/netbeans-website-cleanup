== Developing with Web Application Frameworks

link:web-app2.png[image:web-app2-cut1.png[][font-11]#Click image for fullscreen preview#]

NetBeans IDE supports various Web application frameworks, including all the specifications for Web application development provided as part of the Java EE specification. You can also customize the IDE to work with additional frameworks of your choice.

    [overview-right]#link:ee-6-web-profile.png[image:ee-6-web-profile-cut.png[]]#

=== Java EE 6 Web Profile Support

The link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/javaee6-standards-jsp-141130.html[Java EE 6 Web Profile] defines a subset of specifications that can be used to build Web applications. In addition to supporting the full Java EE specification, NetBeans provides out of the box support for the Web profile, including support for JSF, JSPs, Servlets.

     [overview-left]#link:jsf-dev.png[image:jsf-dev-cut.png[]]#

=== JSF Development

NetBeans IDE supports the latest JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.1 standard, as well as the older 2.0 and 1.2 standards. NetBeans IDE supports Facelets, the official view technology for JSF 2.1. You can create a new web application project based on the Facelets framework and work with standard JSF reference implementation components.

The IDE also supports various JSF component libraries (*PrimeFaces, RichFaces, ICEfaces*) that can simplify the development of facelet pages.

     [overview-right]#link:jsf-crud-gen.png[image:jsf-crud-gen-cut.png[]]#

=== Wizard Based Client Generation

Use the JSF CRUD application generator (Create/Read/Update/Delete) to create a complete functional JSF page for manipulating data from a database. The New File wizard can generate customizable CRUD JSF pages from existing entities. Use the customizable HTML and JSF components palettes to drag and drop HTML and JSF forms into web pages and to generate JSF data tables from entities. The ability to create and work with Facelets templates is also provided.

The IDE now generates code using annotations instead of deployment descriptors where possible.

|=== JSF Templates Support

 |

=== JSP Development

 |

=== Hibernate Support

 

|[overview-centre]#image:template-wizard-cut.png[]#
The IDE provides a Facelets Template wizard for creating Facelets templates, and a Facelets Template Client wizard for creating files that rely on a template.

 |

[overview-centre]#image:jsp-dev-cut.png[]#
In JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, the editor assists you with code completion, hypertext navigation, error checking, and debugging. You can drag and drop code snippets from a pallete. There is support for creating and using custom tag libraries.

link:../../kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps.html[Introduction to developing Web applications with JSP]

 |

[overview-centre]#image:hibernate-web-apps.png[]#
Hibernate libraries are automatically bundled with your application when you select the Hibernate framework in the New Project wizard. The IDE provides wizards for creating Hibernate reverse engineering and configuration XML files and POJO classes.

link:../../kb/docs/web/hibernate-webapp.html[Using Hibernate in a Web Application]

 

|=== Spring Support

 |

=== Struts Support

 |

=== Other Frameworks

 

|[overview-centre]#image:spring-completion.png[]#
Select the Spring framework in the New Project wizard and immediately start out with a skeleton Spring Web MVC application. Take advantage of refactoring (including XML configuration files), and code completion in the editor.

link:../../kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps-spring.html[Introduction to Spring Web MVC]

 |

[overview-centre]#image:struts.png[]#
Select the Struts framework to create flexible web applications based on standard technologies, such as JSP pages, JavaBeans, resource bundles, and XML. Benefit from code completion for Struts tags, and Struts Javadoc pop-ups in the editor.

link:../../kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps-struts.html[Introduction to the Struts Web Framework]

 |

[overview-centre]#image:plugin-portal-uc.png[]#
You can install additional plugins providing support for other frameworks, when provided, from the IDE's Update Center.

For example, the *Wicket* plugin can be installed to enable support for the Wicket framework.
