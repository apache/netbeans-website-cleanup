=== Deploy, Debug, Monitor and Profile

You can deploy your applications to GlassFish, WebLogic, Tomcat or JBoss server. The Deploy on Save feature lets you see changes to your application immediately after you save files in the editor. You can also place breakpoints in your Java or JSP files and debug your app, or profile it using the NetBeans profiler. There is also the HTTP Server-side monitor that enables you to diagnose problems with data flow from JSP and servlet execution on the web server.
