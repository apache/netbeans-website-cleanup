NetBeans IDE lets you work easily and intuitively with a range of popular versioning systems

  [overview-right]#link:ide-collaboration-version-full.png[image:ide-collaboration-version-cut.png[]]#

=== Version Control Tools

Out of the box, NetBeans IDE lets you access Git, Mercurial, and Subversion repositories. Plugins are available for working with CVS and ClearCase repositories.

The NetBeans editor uses color coding to highlight lines that have been added, deleted, and modified. Tools are provided to pull, push, fetch, shelve, and view changes, diffs, and local history, as well as to resolve merge conflicts intuitively. Visual tools are provided for complex activities, such as merging a feature branch back into the trunk, to do diffs between branches and revisions, to switch between queues, and to support rebase operations.

|[overview-centre]#image:versioning-git.png[]#
Since Git is a distributed revision control system, you typically begin by using the IDE to clone an external repository to work with. Use the IDE to push your changes back to the original repository or to export your changes and send them to the owner.

[overview-centre]#image:versioning-mercurial.png[]#
The IDE's Mercurial support lets you clone repositories and to manage changes to version-controlled files as you work. In the IDE, you can call Mercurial commands on both files and directories in the Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. Also see link:http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/mercurial-queues.html[Mercurial Queues Guide].

[overview-centre]#image:versioning-subversion.png[]#
The IDE's Subversion support lets you to manage the evolution of changes in version-controlled files by displaying status information directly in the IDE's various windows (e.g. Projects, Files, Favorites, Versioning) so that you can call Subversion commands as you work.
