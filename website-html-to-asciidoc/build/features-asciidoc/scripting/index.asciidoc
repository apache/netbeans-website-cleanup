*The NetBeans IDE is not only your best choice for Java development, but you also get integrated support for dynamic languages — all in one powerful tool.*

|===
|=== PHP

NetBeans PHP IDE provides a fast integrated development environment for creating, running, and debugging PHP applications in one small download.

See link:../php/index.html[PHP Development].

|=== HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

The NetBeans IDE offers full editor support for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Take advantage of full syntax highlighting, code completion, pop-up documentation, and error checking for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including HTML 5, JavaScript 1.7 and semantic highlighting for E4X (embedded XML objects). The Editor recognizes HTML code in JavaScript files and JavaScript code in HTML files. The Editor also recognizes HTML and JavaScript in XHTML, PHP and JSP files.

==== HTML image:improved_small.gif[]

You can use the editor in the IDE to quickly surround code with a tag or remove a surrounding tag by using new hints. You can remove inline styles to a style block or .css file.

==== CSS image:improved_small.gif[]

NetBeans IDE supports for CSS 3. Refactoring, semantic highlighting, mark occurrences and other features have been adapted to CSS3 code. CSS code completion has been expanded to complete html elements, CSS3 properties and their values, new pseudo classes and pseudo elements, and namespace prefixes. Vendor-specific properties (dash prefix properties) have also been added to code completion. The Navigator window now shows css classes, ids, elements, namespaces and rules in separate element sets.

==== JavaScript

When you specify in the JavaScript Options panel browser types and versions, the editor provides you with browser compatibility information while you type.

Drag and drop handy code snippets for forms and tables from the HTML Palette into the editor. Edit CSS rules and preview the results in the visual CSS editor.

|=== Groovy and Grails

The NetBeans IDE directly supports Groovy, a dynamic scripting language for the Java Platform, and Grails, a web application framework that leverages the Groovy language. Use it to develop 100% pure Groovy applications, or mix Groovy with Java and take advantage of Groovy's dynamic nature in your Java projects.
