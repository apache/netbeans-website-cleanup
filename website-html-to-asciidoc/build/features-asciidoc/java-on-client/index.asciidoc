NetBeans IDE helps you quickly and efficiently develop Java clients, for Java SE, using JavaFX and Swing, as well as Java ME and embedded applications.

=== JavaFX

JavaFX is the next step in the evolution of Java as a rich client platform. It is designed to provide a lightweight, hardware-accelerated Java UI platform for enterprise business applications. With JavaFX, developers can create JavaFX applications completely in the Java programming language using standard Java development tools. You can access native system capabilities, or seamlessly connect to server-based middleware applications.

The IDE provides JavaFX projects and integration with JavaFX Scene Builder, together with editors, debuggers, and sample projects.

=== Swing

Design Swing GUIs by dragging and positioning GUI components from a palette onto a canvas. The GUI builder automatically takes care of the correct spacing and alignment. Click into JLabels, JButtons, ButtonGroups, JTrees, JTextFields, ComboBoxes and edit their properties directly in place.

You can use the GUI builder to prototype GUIs right in front of customers.
