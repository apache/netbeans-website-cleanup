== JavaFX

link:client-javafx-main-full.png[image:client-javafx-main-cut.png[][font-11]#Click image for fullscreen preview#]

JavaFX is the next step in the evolution of Java as a rich client platform. It is designed to provide a lightweight, hardware-accelerated Java UI platform for enterprise business applications. With JavaFX, developers can create JavaFX applications completely in the Java programming language using standard Java development tools. You can access native system capabilities, or seamlessly connect to server-based middleware applications.

=== Templates and GUI Editing

NetBeans IDE gives you skeleton JavaFX applications in the form of project templates. In addition, the IDE provides a set of sample applications, some of which can be recreated step by step by following a related tutorial available on NetBeans.org.

Via the NetBeans Options window, you can register the Scene Builder so that FXML files will automatically be opened into it.

=== FXML Editor

The IDE provides an XML editor with support for FXML, the XML-based declarative markup language for defining user interfaces in JavaFX applications.

=== Deployment Tools

Build and run a JavaFX application as you build and run a standard Java SE application.

In the IDE, you can configure a JavaFX project to run as a standalone application, via Java Web Start, or in a browser.

=== Visual Debugger

Debug a JavaFX GUI application without looking into the source code and control the execution flow in terms of high-level structures.

Choose "Take GUI Snapshot" to make a screenshot of the application GUI that serves as a basis of the Visual Debugger functionality.
