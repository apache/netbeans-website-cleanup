*Best of both worlds: The OSGi and the NetBeans Runtime Container co-exist.*

|===
|=== OSGi Framework Interoperability

 

The OSGi Framework is a module and service registry system for creating modular applications. With the NetBeans IDE you can now easily create OSGi bundles to use in Java applications and NetBeans Platform-based applications.

=== OSGi meets NetBeans

In the NetBeans IDE it is now simple to use existing OSGi bundles in your NetBeans Platform applications. You create a bridge that allows you to reuse and execute OSGi bundles next to native NetBeans modules.

=== OSGi in Maven and Ant Projects

 

The NetBeans IDE enables you to create and build pure OSGi bundles from a Maven archetype and then access the bundles from applications that are running in an OSGi container, either your existing Java applications or Platform-based applications. You can add binary artifacts (JARs) of a group of related OSGi bundles as an extra cluster to your Ant-based NetBeans Platform applications.

Use the OSGi submenu in any Ant-based Platform application project's context menu to convert the application fully to OSGi bundles. You can run it natively in the OSGi container without the need for a bridged NetBeans module system.

=== OSGi Containers: Felix and Equinox

 

You can now run your OSGi bundles in the Apache Felix OSGi runtime container that is bundled with NetBeans IDE. The Equinox-based Platform Application under New Project > Samples > NetBeans Modules, and related tutorials, will help you integrate OSGi bundles into a Platform Application powered by the Equinox runtime container.
