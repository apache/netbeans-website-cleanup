*The visual layout tool for JavaFX applications.*

*Warning:* JavaFX Composer is a tool for the JavaFX 1.x scripting language. This scripting language is not included in JavaFX 2.x. For this reason, JavaFX Composer cannot be used with JavaFX 2.0.

The last version of NetBeans IDE that supports JavaFX 1.x and JavaFX Composer is NetBeans IDE 6.9.1. JavaFX 2.0 support is available starting in NetBeans IDE 7.1. For more information about using JavaFX 2.0 with NetBeans IDE, see the link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/JavaFX[JavaFX NetBeans wiki]. For more information about using JavaFX 1.x with NetBeans IDE, see the link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/JavaFX1.3[JavaFX 1.3 NetBeans wiki].

|=== JavaFX Composer

 

The JavaFX Composer is a visual layout tool for JavaFX applications, like the NetBeans GUI Builder is for Java SE applications. Create GUIs with standard JavaFX controls and use states to define application flow.

|=== State Management

 

The JavaFX States Window gives you acute control over a component's animation, visibility, and properties. To control components you define states, sets of property values that apply at the same point of time.

Define the default properties in the master state, then create parallel sets of states for properties that change independently. Your application responds to user input by switching to another state.


=== For All the Screens of Your Life

 

The JavaFX Composer makes it easy to develop applications with multiple screens, that can be used on mobile devices, TV systems, the desktop, and in web browsers. Every project comes with an IDE-generated Ant build script to build and run your application. The build script is pre-configured for running your application as Web Start (JNLP), as browser Applet, on the JavaFX mobile emulator, or on the JavaFX TV emulator.

|=== Built-in Data Connectivity image:new_small.gif[]

If your JavaFX application requires connecting to data sources, use the project templates to easily create a JavaFX Business Desktop Application or a JavaFX Mobile Business Application. Use the Design View to connect the user interface to data sources, such as RESTful web services, databases, local filesystem, or data files.
