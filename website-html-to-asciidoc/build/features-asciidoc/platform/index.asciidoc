== The NetBeans Platform

image:platform_450px.jpg[]

*Developing a desktop application on top of the NetBeans Platform can save years of developer time.*

=== A Generic Desktop Application Framework

The NetBeans Platform is a generic base for desktop applications. It provides the services common to almost all large desktop applications: window management, menus, settings and storage, an update manager, and file access. Get a head start by reusing these standard components, allowing you to concentrate fully on your application's business logic.

The NetBeans Platform provides all of these out of the box. You don't need to manually code these or other basic features, yourself, anymore. See what some NetBeans-based applications look like. The platform does not add a lot of overhead to your application - but it can save a huge amount of time and work.

The NetBeans Platform provides a reliable and flexible application architecture. Your application does not have to look anything like an IDE. It can save you years of development time. The NetBeans Platform gives you a time-tested architecture for free. An architecture that encourages sustainable development practices. Because the NetBeans Platform architecture is modular, it's easy to create applications that are robust and extensible.
